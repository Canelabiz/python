1. Learn Python (3 please)
2. Do a lot of Codewars up to where lvl 6 problems are very easy to solve and lvl 5 problems are solvable but requires a bit of thinking.
3. Learn Git
4. Create a GitHub account
5. Make some projects and put them in your Github
6. Read about data structures and algorithms, time and space complexity
7. Create a leetcode repository and keep your solutions to leetcode problems in that repository, working on 1-2 problems a day is enough (easy-medium problems, sometimes hard if you can) + try to understand what is the time/space complexity of your problems
8. Learn what are servers/clients, HTTP, REST.
9. More projects (HTTP servers), keep doing (7) 3 times a week
10. Learn about tests. Unit tests, integration tests, mocks, etc. Now go back and create tests for all (7, 9)
11. Learn Docker
12. Include Docker in all your (9).
13. You are more than ready

Throughout all of this. Never copy/paste a line of code. Always write everything yourself. Understand, I mean deeply understand what you are doing. You'll encounter bugs, solve them and understand the underlying cause. Also, read Clean Code after step 2.
